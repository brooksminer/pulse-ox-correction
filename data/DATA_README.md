# Important note about data access.
The data for this project is a restricted-access resource due to the confidentiality of patient health records.
Individuals who would like to access the data can follow steps to become an approved user here (scroll down to the bottom header, 'Files'):
https://physionet.org/content/mit-critical-datathon-2023/1.0.0/

Once an individual has completed these steps, they can download the data file (mimic_pulseOx_data.csv) from PhysioNet, and then run all of the code in this repository by placing that file in the data directory.
